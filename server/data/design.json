  "description": "A logo is a visual representation of your brand, so why tell people what you do if you could just show them? Use simple icons to communicate who you are.Remember the brand vibe we talked about earlier? The use of the plane and the sun here makes me feel excited and reminds me of warm sunny holidays.Visual puns are a designer’s best friend too – here Frost Bites have created a quirky ‘bite’ to show that they are a food company. This is really easily achieved by overlapping two circles that are the same color as the background.",

  "description": "Sometimes the most effective site is the least complex one. One-page sites work best when their subject matter is narrower, like a portfolio or the presentation of a single idea. These sites evoke the feeling of holding a flyer or reading a poster. All the information you need to review is in one place without the distraction of navigation or searching multiple pages. It lets its subject be the focus of attention. This makes it more likely that a casual viewer will read the entire resume since everything they need is right up front.",
